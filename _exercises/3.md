title: "Search for Last Occurrence"
description: > 
    Implement a <code>search</code> function, in Scheme, that
    <ul>
        <li>accepts a list <code>lst</code> and a query (a value to be searched in <code>lst</code>) <code>query</code>, and </li>
        <li>outputs the <i>last index</i> at which the query is found in the list. If the query is not in the list, outputs -1</li>
    </ul>
    Note that index starts from \( 0\), not 1. Below are some examples:
    <ul>
        <li><code>(search '(1 2 3) 3)</code> will output <code>3</code>.</li>
        <li><code>(search '(1 2 10 10 4) 10)</code> will output <code>3</code>. Even though <code>10</code> is found in both indexes 2 and 3, index 3 is the <i>last occurrence</i> at which <code>10</code> appears in the list.</li>
        <li><code>(search '(1 2 3 4) 5)</code> will output <code>-1</code> because the query <code>5</code> is not in the list.</li>
    </ul>
    (Hint: what happens when you encounter a query value in the list? Do you stop searching or do you still search through the remaining list? When do you stop? What is the base case? Remember, you have to output the <i>index</i> at the end. How will you keep track of the index as you are searching through the list?).
