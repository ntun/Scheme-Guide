title: "Dot Product"
description: > 
    Given two vectors \( \textbf{v}, \textbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n \), the dot product of these two vectors are defined as follows:
    <center>
    \( \displaystyle \textbf{v} \times \textbf{w} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i w_i \)
    </center>
    where \( \textbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n) \) and \( \textbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n) \). 
    <br><br>
    Now, consider the aforementioned two vectors as lists: \( \textbf{v} = \ '(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n) \) and \( \textbf{w} = \ '(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n) \). Implement a function <code>dot_product</code> that takes two lists as inputs, recursively calculates its dot product value, and outputs that value. Assume that the two inputs have the same size, and no error checking is necessary.
