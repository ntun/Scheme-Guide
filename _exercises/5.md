title: Transposition of Matrix
description: > 
    A matrix can be rewritten as two-dimensional (nested) arrays or lists in a computer. Thus, the following matrix:
    <center>
    \( \begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 \\ b_1 & b_2 \end{bmatrix}\)
    </center>
    <br>
    can be rewritten as nested lists (lists within a list) in Scheme:
    <br><br>
    <center>
    \( '((a_1, a_2) \ \ \ (b_1, b_2)) \)
    </center>
    <br>
    A tranpose operation, \( T \), on a matrix is a diagonal flipping of the matrix: rows become columns and columns become rows. Read the Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose" target="_blank">Tranpose</a> article for more explanation.
    <br><br>
    Now, implement a <code>transpose</code> function that takes a two-dimensional list (a matrix) as an input and outputs its tranposition (not print; it has to output 2d list). Assume that the input is always going to have a valid size (for instance, all rows will have same number of elements, etc), and no error checking is required
