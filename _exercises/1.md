title: "Search for Maximum Number"
description: > 
 The usual algorithm for finding the maximum number in a list, <code>numlist</code>, that contains \(n\) numbers is as follows:
 <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
 i. Define and initialize the variable <code>max</code> to &nbsp \( -\infty \) &nbsp (negative infinity). <br>
     ii. Iterate through the list, starting from index \( 0 \) till \(n-1\) (this is the same as setting a for loop   <code>for(size_t i = 0; i < n; i++) { ... }</code> ) <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. If the element at that position/index is greater than <code>max</code>, set <code>max</code> equals to that element. In terms of (C++) code, it looks like:
 <pre class="prettyprint language-cpp">
 if (numlist[i] > max) {
     max = numlist[i];
  }
 </pre>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv. Go to the next element in <code>numlist</code> and start from step (iii). If there is no next element (i.e. you are at the last element of the list), go to step (v). <br>
     v. Return the value of <code>max</code>. That is the maximum number in <code>numlist</code>.
 </div>
 <br>
 The above approach is definitely an iterative one. Implement a <i>recursive</i> algorithm, in Scheme, to find the maximum number in <code>numlist</code>. Ideally, the function should be defined as <br> <code>(maxnum numlist)</code>, where <code>maxnum</code> is the function that accepts a list <code>numlist</code> as a parameter and returns the maximum number from that list. If the list is empty, return &nbsp \( -\infty \).
